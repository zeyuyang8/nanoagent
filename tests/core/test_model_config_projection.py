"""Pins the nanoagent -> leaninfer config bridge: ModelConfig is a strict subset of LeanInferConfig.

nanoagent and leaninfer keep SEPARATE model schemas on purpose, because their contracts differ:
:class:`~nanoagent.config.ModelConfig` is all-``MISSING`` (a run config must set every knob
explicitly — no silent defaults), while :class:`~leaninfer.LeanInferConfig` carries concrete
defaults so it can be built in code (``leaninfer.infer``). Merging them would cost one of those
two properties.

The price of two schemas is that they can drift, so :meth:`nanoagent.core.model.Model.from_config`
translates by FIELD-NAME PROJECTION rather than a hand-written copy. This test pins the invariant
that projection relies on — every ModelConfig field name exists on LeanInferConfig with the same
type — so adding a knob to one side and forgetting the other fails here rather than silently
dropping the knob at runtime (which is invisible: the request just goes out mis-configured).

What it consumes: the two dataclass schemas only — no network, no backend, no SGLang.

Run (from the repo root)::

    python3 -m pytest tests/core/test_model_config_projection.py -x -q
