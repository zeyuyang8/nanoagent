"""Offline test: :func:`nanoagent.harness.run.batch.run_batch` ISOLATES a failing task — one rollout that
raises does NOT sink its siblings (the contract a trainer's deferred batch relies on — a single
bad rollout must not lose a whole batch).

Everything is in-process — no model server, GPU, or network. A scripted
:class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.ChatModel` answers ``"DONE"`` in one turn, except for the one task whose
user turn (``messages[-1]["content"]``) is ``"boom?"``, on which it raises ``RuntimeError``. The
single test drives :func:`~nanoagent.harness.run.batch.run_batch` over a 3-task batch at ``concurrency=3`` (the
MIDDLE task booms) under ``tmp_path`` and asserts the failed task is recorded as an ``error`` row
while BOTH siblings still complete with ``answer`` — the isolation ``run_one``'s ``try/except``
gives ``asyncio.gather``.

This arm is unhit by the other nanoagent batch tests: every test where the model RAISES drives a
SINGLE-task list (``test_run_batch_resume.py``, ``test_batch.py`` timeout cases) and every
MULTI-task batch test uses a model that always succeeds (``test_batch.py``,
``test_run_batch_concurrency.py``) — none combines a raising task with succeeding siblings.
A benchmark runner's equivalent is pinned on its own side, but
nanoagent's distinct ``run_batch`` fan-out was not.

Non-vacuity (verified by in-place mutation of batch.py, then reverted): make ``run_one``'s
``except Exception`` re-``raise`` so ``asyncio.gather`` propagates — ``run_batch`` raises and the
whole batch is sunk — and this test goes RED.

    python3 -m pytest tests/harness/run/test_run_batch_error_isolation.py -q
