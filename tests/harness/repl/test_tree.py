"""Offline tests for :mod:`nanoagent.harness.repl.tree` — the conversation as a tree of branches.

The properties that make branching worth having:

* **a fork is isolated** — work done on the child must not reach the parent, and switching back
  must find the parent exactly as it was. A shallow copy would pass a length check and fail this,
  since every message is a mutable dict the loop edits in place.
* **the live branch is the live list** — ``tree.messages`` IS the object :meth:`Agent.run
  <nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run>` appends to, so nothing has to be copied back after a turn.
* **save/load round-trips the shape** — branches, parents and which one is current.
* **resume reads both formats** — a ``.session.json`` restores the tree; a ``.traj.json``
  (a batch rollout, or a chat from before this existed) restores its transcript as one branch.

Fully offline: no model, no server, ``tmp_path`` only.

Run (from the repo root)::

    python3 -m pytest tests/harness/repl/test_tree.py -x -q
