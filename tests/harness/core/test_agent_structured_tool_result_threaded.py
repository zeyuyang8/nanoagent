"""Offline pin: a STRUCTURED (non-string) tool result is ``str()``-threaded into BOTH the
``role="tool"`` message content and the per-call ``output`` log, from one source.

This pins the "agent also calls --> a search tool" edge on the realistic case the search tool returns a STRUCTURED result (a dict of hits, not a
plain string). That structured payload must be ``str()``-stringified faithfully as it
crosses the :meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.tool.Tool.invoke` -> :meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent._run_one`
seam, landing as a ``str`` in BOTH sinks fed from the single ``text`` in ``_run_one``:

* the ``{"role": "tool", ..., "content"}`` message the next model turn sees, and
* :attr:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.AgentResult.tool_calls`'s ``output`` (the trajectory row
  the scorer and the trainer read back).

Disjoint from the existing agent-loop tests, which all return STRINGS from ``run`` (so
``str()`` is a no-op and the structured-payload path is never exercised):
``test_agent_dispatch_call_log.py`` / ``test_agent_tool_messages.py`` /
``test_trajectory_multi_turn_capture.py`` use string-returning echo tools, and
``test_tool.py`` pins ``Tool.invoke``'s ``str()`` in isolation on a scalar int — never
building a ``role="tool"`` message or a call_log row from a structured return. Also
disjoint from the landed advertise-tool-specs (request-OUT) and multi-turn on-disk
(capture-BACK) tests.

What it consumes (read-only): the REAL :meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run` loop, plus
:class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Reply` / :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.ToolCall` /
:class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.StopReason` to script the model and a pure-Python
:class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.tool.Tool` returning a dict. No model server / network / GPU / native
extension — the ``ChatModel`` is an in-process scripted stand-in.

What it produces: nothing — purely in-memory, no disk or other side effects.

How to run it (from the repo root)::

    python3 -m pytest tests/harness/core/test_agent_structured_tool_result_threaded.py -x -q
