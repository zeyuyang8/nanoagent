"""Offline test pinning Agent.run's cumulative DOLLAR-COST summation across turns
(:meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run`).

``AgentResult.cost`` is the run's cumulative dollar cost — the dollar-denominated parallel of the
cumulative-token ``usage`` that :mod:`~nanoagent.tests.test_usage_accumulate` guards. nanoagent is the
rollout layer that captures the agent's LLM calls as the trajectory; ``cost`` is read alongside ``usage`` as the trajectory's cost/reward signal and gates
``cost_limit``. :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run` builds it by starting ``cost = 0.0`` and folding
each model turn in place (``agent.py``: ``cost += reply.cost``).

That MULTI-TURN summation was UNPINNED: every other test asserting ``result.cost`` runs exactly one
cost-charging turn (the ``cost_limit`` guard trips before a 2nd — see
:mod:`~nanoagent.tests.test_agent_run_limits`), and the trajectory/cli tests set ``cost`` on a
directly-constructed :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.AgentResult` without running the loop. So the mutation
``cost += reply.cost`` -> ``cost = reply.cost`` (overwrite instead of add) keeps only the LAST turn's
cost and silently mis-bills every multi-turn rollout, yet survives the whole suite. These tests drive
a real multi-turn ``Agent.run`` (no ``cost_limit``, so every turn charges) and assert the cumulative
total, so the overwrite makes them FAIL.

What it consumes: :class:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` driven by an in-process scripted ChatModel + a
no-op tool — mirrors ``test_agent_run_limits._NeverAnswersModel`` / ``test_agent_on_step_snapshot``
(no model server, network, or GPU; no side effects).
