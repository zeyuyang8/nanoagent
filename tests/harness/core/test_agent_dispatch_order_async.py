"""Offline test pinning that nanoagent records call_log in DISPATCH order under async tools.

Regression test for a trajectory-determinism bug. When ONE model reply carries multiple tool
calls, :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent._dispatch` runs them concurrently with ``asyncio.gather``.
``gather`` returns its results (the ``role="tool"`` messages) in INPUT order, so
:attr:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.AgentResult.messages` is correctly ordered. But if each per-call
coroutine appended its own ``call_log`` row *after* its ``await``, the rows would land in
COMPLETION order — so for genuinely-suspending async tools (a real HTTP / search call)
a slower call's row lands after a faster one and :attr:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.AgentResult.tool_calls`
(which IS ``call_log``) ends up ordered differently from ``messages``: the trajectory disagrees
with itself. nanoagent's trajectory is consumed downstream by a trainer and a scorer,
so a self-inconsistent ordering is a real correctness
defect — not cosmetic.

Drives the REAL :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` loop (mirrors
``test_agent_dispatch_call_log.py``'s scripted-``ChatModel`` + ``Tool``-subclass pattern) with
TWO **async** tools of inverted latency emitted in ONE reply: a ``"slow"`` tool dispatched FIRST
whose ``run`` sleeps 50ms, and a ``"fast"`` tool dispatched SECOND that sleeps 0. The slow tool
finishes LAST, so the buggy append-inside-``_run_one`` shape yields ``result.tool_calls`` in
completion order ``["fast", "slow"]``; the fix populates ``call_log`` from ``gather``'s
input-ordered return list, giving ``["slow", "fast"]`` — agreeing with the (already-correct)
``messages`` order. :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.tool.Tool.invoke` awaits an awaitable ``run`` result, so an
``async def run`` genuinely suspends. No model server / network / GPU; no side effects.

The existing ``test_agent_dispatch_call_log.py`` uses SYNC tool ``run`` methods that never yield,
so its append order coincidentally equals dispatch order and it cannot catch this; this test adds
the async-suspension case. Reverting ``_dispatch``/``_run_one`` to the append-inside-``_run_one``
shape makes assertion (a) below FAIL (tool_calls come back ``["fast", "slow"]``) while ``messages``
stays correct — proving non-vacuity by mutation.

    python3 -m pytest tests/harness/core/test_agent_dispatch_order_async.py -x -q
