"""Offline test pinning that Agent.run resets EVERY registered tool at run-start
(:meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run`).

nanoagent is the rollout layer whose ``run_batch`` reuses ONE
:class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` across many fanned-out tasks. The per-task isolation
contract that makes that reuse safe lives at the very top of :meth:`Agent.run`::

    for tool in self._tools.values():
        tool.reset()

so each task starts every registered tool from a clean slate and no per-tool state (e.g. a
stateful tool's per-task retrieval budget) leaks from the prior task. Nothing drove
``Agent.run`` to confirm this: ``test_tool_base`` calls ``Tool.reset()`` in isolation,
``test_code.py`` test ``CodeExec.reset`` directly, and the twice-run agent tests
(``test_agent_cost_accumulate``, ``test_agent_token_limit``) build a FRESH Agent with
stateless tools that never override ``reset``. So DELETING that loop passes the entire
existing suite.

This drives the SAME Agent across two ``run`` calls with two tools whose ``reset()`` bumps a
counter; the scripted model answers on turn 1 with no tool call, so each run does exactly one
query and ends on :attr:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.StopReason.ANSWER` without ever invoking a tool —
the counters move ONLY because run-start reset fired. Registering two distinctly-named tools
pins the loop visiting EVERY tool (not just the first), and asserting 0 -> 1 -> 2 pins
once-per-run (not once-in-``__init__``, nor once-ever). Deleting the loop leaves both counters
at 0, so the test FAILS — non-vacuity.

What it consumes: :class:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` driven by an in-process scripted ChatModel +
two reset-counting tools — mirrors ``test_agent_cost_accumulate`` / ``test_agent_token_limit``
(no model server, network, or GPU; no side effects).
