"""Offline test: ``Agent.run`` ADVERTISES each tool's OpenAI function spec to the model.

This pins the request-OUT half of the proxy seam — nanoagent transparently proxies the
agent's LLM calls: when :meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run` calls its chat model it
hands the model every registered tool as that tool's :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.tool.Tool.to_openai_spec`
output. :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` builds ``self._tool_specs = [t.to_openai_spec() for t in
tools]`` once at construction and passes it as the ``tools`` argument of every
``self._model.query(messages, self._tool_specs)`` call (``agent.py``).

No existing nanoagent test captures the ``tools`` argument handed to ``ChatModel.query`` and
asserts its content: ``test_tool*.py`` pin ``Tool.to_openai_spec()`` standalone,
and ``test_context.py``'s mock records query *messages* but never the ``tools`` arg. This is
the request-OUT complement to the capture-BACK trajectory tests.

A scripted :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.ChatModel` (``_RecordToolsModel``) records the tool-specs
argument of every ``query`` call into ``seen_tools`` and answers on turn 1 with no tool call, so
the real ``Agent.run`` terminates cleanly (``StopReason.ANSWER``) after exactly one query. A
distinctive pure-Python :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.tool.Tool` (``lookup_widget`` — a docstring
description plus a non-trivial parameters schema with a property and a required list) is the one
registered tool, so the recorded specs can be compared exact-dict against a fresh
``to_openai_spec()`` and field-by-field against literal expected content.

Non-vacuity: changing ``agent.py``'s ``query(messages, self._tool_specs)`` to
``query(messages, [])`` (or emptying ``self._tool_specs``) makes the exact-spec assertion fail.

Fully offline: an in-process scripted model + a pure-Python tool — no openai / inference stack /
network / server / GPU / native extension, and no disk. The ``on_delta`` keyword mirrors the one
the real model backend accepts; the agent loop itself queries positionally.
