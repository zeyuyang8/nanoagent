"""Pin the shape of the ``step_durations`` entry appended on Agent.run's ANSWER step
(:meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run`).

Each completed step appends one ``{"model", "tools"}`` timing dict to ``step_durations``,
built from the ``pending`` dict initialised in ``Agent.run`` as
``pending = {"model": 0.0, "tools": 0.0}``. On the final ANSWER step the model returns no
tool call, so the dispatch branch (which would overwrite ``pending["tools"]`` with a measured
wall-clock) never runs and the loop appends ``pending`` whole: the entry
keeps BOTH keys and its ``tools`` value stays the literal ``0.0`` init — deterministically, no
timing flakiness. ``step_durations`` is consumer-facing (serialized into every saved trajectory
-> reaches the trainer and the scorer), so this success-path shape is a contract worth pinning.

Gap this closes: the suite already pins ``step_durations`` LENGTH and copy/identity
(``test_agent_on_step_snapshot``) and the ERROR-path entries (``test_agent_error_path``,
``test_agent_error_no_pending_step``), but no test asserts the keys/values of the entry
appended on a successful answer run.

Non-vacuity (inline mutation, not coverage): replacing the answer-branch append with
``step_durations.append({"model": pending["model"]})`` (dropping the ``tools`` key) survives the
whole current suite but flips the ``set(...) == {"model", "tools"}`` assertion below, failing
this test. Verified by hand, then reverted.

What it consumes: :class:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent` driven by an in-process scripted ChatModel
that answers on turn 1 with no tool call — no cost_limit/context_window, no model server,
network, or GPU; no side effects.
