"""Pin Agent.run's ERROR path when the exception is raised with NO step in flight
(:meth:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run`).

nanoagent is the ROLLOUT layer, which must still emit a scorable terminal ERROR result on
failure. :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run`'s ``except Exception`` branch
guards that with ``if pending is not None: step_durations.append(pending)`` — it appends the
in-flight step's partial timing ONLY when a step is mid-flight. The complementary
``test_agent_error_path`` cases all raise from ``model.query`` (where ``pending`` was just
set), so they only ever exercise the TRUE branch. This file pins the FALSE branch (arc
``240->242``): an exception raised when ``pending is None`` — already reset to ``None`` after
the completed step's durations were appended — must NOT append again (no double-counting,
no trailing ``None``).

The realistic trigger: a RUNNING ``on_step`` snapshot fires AFTER a tool step completes
(``pending`` reset to ``None``); the trajectory writer behind that callback hits a disk error
and raises. ``Agent.run`` then enters its ``except`` branch with ``pending is None``.

Everything is in-process: a scripted :class:`_OneToolStepModel` returns one ``noop`` tool
call so a step completes, and a :class:`_WriterCallback` raises on the RUNNING snapshot only
(``content`` is carried so the error result's best-effort answer is non-empty). No model
server, network, or GPU; mirrors ``test_agent_error_path``. ``Agent.run`` logs the failure
via ``logger.exception`` before re-raising, so pytest captures one traceback (expected — the
test asserts the re-raise, it does not suppress the log).
