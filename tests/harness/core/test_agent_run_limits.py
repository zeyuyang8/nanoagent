"""Pin Agent.run's cap/termination contract and the duplicate-tool guard (:mod:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent`).

nanoagent is the ROLLOUT layer, and flow control caps each rollout's turns/cost to bound
worst-case task time; nanoagent's run mode is where those caps live. The two run-mode caps and the constructor's tool-name guard were UNCOVERED
for :meth:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run` — the existing limit tests drive
``InteractiveSession``, a separate loop, and ``__init__``'s duplicate-tool ``ValueError`` was
untested anywhere:

  * MAX_STEPS  — a model that never returns a final answer exhausts ``range(max_steps)`` and
    returns ``StopReason.MAX_STEPS`` with ``steps == max_steps``.
  * COST_LIMIT — the cost guard is checked at the TOP of the loop, BEFORE the next query, so
    with ``cost_limit`` below the per-turn cost it trips on the turn AFTER the cost crosses
    the cap: one turn runs (the model is queried once, cost accrues), then the next iteration
    returns ``StopReason.COST_LIMIT`` with ``steps == 1`` and one turn's cost accrued.
  * duplicate tool name — ``Agent.__init__`` collapses ``{t.name: t}`` and raises
    ``ValueError("duplicate tool name in `tools`")`` when two tools share a name.

Everything is in-process: a scripted :class:`_NeverAnswersModel` always returns one ``noop``
tool call (never a final answer) so only a cap can stop the loop, and carries a per-turn
``cost`` to drive the cost guard. Mirrors ``test_context._MockModel``'s shape (incl. the
``on_delta`` kwarg the model backend accepts); no model server, GPU, or network.
