"""Offline tests for :mod:`nanoagent.harness.core.hooks` and its four call sites in :meth:`Agent.run`.

The motivating case is concrete. A harness config whose system prompt says "Call search AT MOST
ONCE" is stating a budget in prose the model may simply ignore — the tools stay general and
enforce nothing. So the headline test writes a
``before_tool`` hook that counts ``search`` calls in :attr:`HookContext.state` and refuses the
second, and pins that the agent's second call really does come back refused, with the tool never
having run.

Also pinned:

* ``before_llm`` injects its string as a user turn, ONCE per step (the malformed-arg retry loop
  re-queries within a step, and a reminder per attempt would stack up copies).
* ``session_start`` fires once per run and ``state`` is per-RUN — a shared ``Agent`` is reused
  across concurrent rollouts, so a budget living on the agent would be one budget K rollouts
  spend from at once. This is the property that would break silently in production and never in
  a single-rollout test, so it is driven through ``asyncio.gather``.
* ``hooks=None`` (the ``hooks: []`` default of every existing config) makes no hook call at all.

Fully offline: scripted in-process models and tools, no server, network or GPU.
