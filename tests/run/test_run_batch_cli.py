"""Offline test for nanoagent's batch CLI orchestration wrapper (:func:`nanoagent.run.cli._run_batch`).

``_run_batch`` is the batch fan-out CLI entry an RL trainer drives (rollout fan-out + resume UX). It loads a :class:`~nanoagent.config.BatchConfig` from ``key=value`` tokens,
wires the progress ``on_start``/``on_done`` callbacks (``on_done`` builds the stop_reason tally via
:func:`~nanoagent.run.progress.format_tally`), runs :func:`~nanoagent.run.batch.run_batch`, prints
``done: N task(s)`` plus the tally, and on Ctrl-C prints a resume hint and returns exit code 130.
``run_batch`` itself is covered by ``test_batch.py`` / ``test_run_batch_resume.py``; this
orchestration wrapper had no tests.

Everything is in-process — no model server, network, or GPU. ``cli.build_agent`` is monkeypatched
to hand back an :class:`~nanoagent.core.agent.Agent` over a scripted model (so no real ``Model``/openai
client is built), and the rich progress bar is sent to an in-memory console so ``capsys`` sees only
``_run_batch``'s own ``print()`` lines.

* ``test_run_batch_happy_path`` — a complete BatchConfig YAML over a 2-row tasks JSONL: rc is 0,
  both ``<id>.traj.json`` trajectories are written, ``results.jsonl`` holds both ids, and stdout
  carries ``done: 2 task(s)`` plus the ``answer=2`` tally (proving the ``on_done`` ->
  ``format_tally`` wiring — an unwired ``on_done`` would leave the tally empty and print
  ``(nothing pending)``).
* ``test_run_batch_keyboard_interrupt_returns_130`` — ``run_batch`` raises ``KeyboardInterrupt``
  (Ctrl-C mid-batch): ``_run_batch`` returns 130, prints the resume hint, and does NOT print the
  ``done:`` summary.

The ``if not cfg.output`` SystemExit branch (cli.py) is intentionally not tested: ``output`` is a
``MISSING`` leaf of BatchConfig, so a config without it fails at load time and the branch is
unreachable (testing it would be vacuous; see CLAUDE.md Simplicity First).
