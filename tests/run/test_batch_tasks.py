"""Offline unit tests for the CLI batch task-selection helpers
(:func:`nanoagent.run.batch.load_tasks` and :func:`nanoagent.run.batch.filter_tasks`).

nanoagent's batch run mode (the rollout fan-out) picks which tasks to run with two pure helpers in :mod:`nanoagent.run.batch`: ``load_tasks`` reads a JSONL of tasks and
``filter_tasks`` narrows it (regex on id, ``a:b`` slice, seeded shuffle). ``test_batch.py`` only
exercises ``run_batch``; these two were untested. Everything here is in-process — no model,
network, or GPU — using ``tmp_path`` files and the helpers' own return values.

* ``test_load_tasks_happy_path`` — a ``{task_id, task}`` JSONL → list of ``(str, str)`` tuples;
  blank lines skipped, non-string ids/tasks str()-ified.
* ``test_load_tasks_accepts_browsecomp_keys`` — ``{query_id, problem}`` rows are accepted as
  fallbacks, and the canonical ``task_id``/``task`` win when both are present.
* ``test_load_tasks_missing_keys_raises`` — a row with neither id nor task key raises
  ``ValueError`` whose message names the file path and the offending (sorted) keys.
* ``test_load_tasks_missing_one_key_raises`` — a row missing only the id (or only the task) also
  raises (the guard is ``task_id is None or task is None``).
* ``test_filter_tasks_regex_keeps_matching_ids`` — ``filter_re`` keeps ids matching the pattern
  via ``re.search`` (an empty pattern is a no-op).
* ``test_filter_tasks_slice_selects_subrange`` — ``slice_spec`` selects ``out[slice(*parts)]``
  (``a:b`` plus open-ended / stepped forms; an empty spec is a no-op).
* ``test_filter_tasks_shuffle_is_seeded_permutation`` — ``shuffle=True`` is deterministic
  (sort by id, then seed ``_SHUFFLE_SEED``) and a permutation of the input.
* ``test_filter_tasks_filter_then_slice_compose_in_order`` — combined, the filter runs before the
  slice.
