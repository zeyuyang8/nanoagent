"""Offline test for the batch driver's concurrency bound (:func:`nanoagent.run.batch.run_batch`).

``run_batch`` gates every rollout behind ``asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency)`` (``batch.py``,
acquired by ``async with semaphore`` at ``batch.py``) — the role map's BLOCK-3
"oversubscribe / keep more rollouts in flight than slots" throttle for the rollout-service
fan-out: no more than ``concurrency`` rollouts may be in flight at once. Everything here is
in-process — no model server, GPU, or network is contacted.

* ``test_run_batch_concurrency_caps_in_flight`` — drive ``run_batch`` over 6 tasks with
  ``concurrency=2`` using a scripted :class:`~nanoagent.core.agent.ChatModel` (the
  ``test_batch._ScriptedModel`` shape) whose single turn bumps a shared in-flight counter,
  records the running peak, sleeps briefly so co-admitted rollouts actually overlap inside
  the semaphore, then decrements and answers in one turn. Asserts the observed peak == 2 (it
  REACHES the cap — so the test isn't vacuous — and never EXCEEDS it) and that all 6 tasks
  complete (6 result rows, 6 ledger lines, 6 trajectory files).

Non-vacuity (mutation proof): replacing ``asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency)`` with
``asyncio.Semaphore(len(pending))`` (or any bound > ``concurrency``) at ``batch.py`` keeps
the rest of the suite green but makes this test's peak == 6, flipping it red. The
``concurrency`` parameter and the ``async with semaphore`` gate otherwise have zero
behavioral coverage.

    python3 -m pytest tests/run/test_run_batch_concurrency.py -q

    Mirrors ``test_batch._ScriptedModel`` (one turn, no tool call, so the agent's first turn is
    the final answer), but instruments concurrency: each turn increments a shared in-flight
    counter, records the running ``peak``, sleeps so every rollout admitted alongside it enters
    its turn before any leaves, then decrements and answers ``"DONE"``. ``run_batch`` shares one
    agent/model across all tasks, so this single instance's ``peak`` is the high-water mark of
    simultaneously in-flight rollouts. The increment/decrement straddle the only ``await``, so
    they never interleave on the single-threaded event loop.
