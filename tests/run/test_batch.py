"""Offline tests for the batch driver's per-rollout wall-clock cap (:func:`nanoagent.run.batch.run_batch`).

Everything is in-process — no model server is contacted. A scripted
:class:`~nanoagent.core.agent.ChatModel` either blocks on ``asyncio.sleep`` (to overrun the cap) or
answers immediately (the fast, no-cap path); each test drives :func:`~nanoagent.run.batch.run_batch`
over one task and asserts on the returned row plus the ``results.jsonl`` ledger under ``tmp_path``.

* ``test_batch_timeout_scores_zero`` — a slow rollout under ``timeout=0.05`` is killed and recorded
  as a score-zero ``error`` row (0 tokens, 0 cost); the ledger holds exactly that one row.
* ``test_batch_no_timeout_completes`` — the same harness with ``timeout=None`` answers normally,
  proving the wrapper is inert when no cap is set.
* ``test_batch_on_step_reports_per_task`` — the ``on_step`` callback fires with ``(task_id,
  result)`` for every task, each ending in its terminal (non-``running``) stop_reason, so a
  caller (the CLI's live per-task rows) can follow progress; an unwired ``on_step`` records nothing.
