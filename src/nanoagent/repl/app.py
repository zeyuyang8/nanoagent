"""Interactive terminal session for the nanoagent agent — mini-swe-agent's `mini` UX.

Type a task, then watch the agent work step by step. Three modes (mini-faithful):

* **confirm** (default) — each proposed tool call waits for you: Enter runs it, a typed
  comment rejects it (the comment is fed back to the model so it re-plans).
* **yolo** — tool calls run immediately.
* **human** — *you* drive: type a shell command and it runs via the bash tool right away;
  switch back to ``/c`` / ``/y`` to hand control to the model.

Slash commands at any prompt: ``/y`` yolo · ``/c`` confirm · ``/u`` human · ``/m`` multiline
comment, all four answered by the reader because they change what the read means; everything
else comes from the table in :mod:`nanoagent.repl.commands` — ``/h`` help · ``/tree`` repo overview ·
``/model <name>`` swap model · ``/img <path>`` show an image · ``/fork`` ``/branches``
``/switch <n>`` for the transcript tree — plus one ``/<stem>`` per ``.md`` in ``commands:``.
Ctrl-C interrupts the current step (aborts the in-flight generation) and drops to the follow-up
prompt; the session stays alive. When the agent finishes, type a follow-up to continue the same
conversation, or Enter to quit.

This module holds NO agent loop of its own: :class:`InteractiveSession` drives
:meth:`nanoagent.core.agent.Agent.run` — the same loop the batch/benchmark path runs — over a
persistent message list, and layers the REPL on top through two wrappers. :class:`_Narrating`
wraps the model (step banner, live streaming, usage footer, Ctrl-C) and :class:`_Gated` wraps
each tool (print the call, ask before running it in confirm mode, print the result). Human mode
is a pre-loop that runs before the agent is handed control. So chat and batch can never drift.

Run (yaml-driven, no flags — a chat YAML is a harness YAML plus the REPL-only leaves `task`,
`yolo`, `output`, `resume`, `commands`, `models`, `theme`, `images`). The toolset comes from the
config's `tools` list; human mode needs a tool named ``bash`` in it to run shell commands directly:
  nanoagent chat chat_cfg=mychat.yaml output=expdir/chat

The session trajectory is always saved on exit, named by the time the chat started:
``<output>/<yymmdd-hhmmss>.traj.json``, where ``output`` is the folder to save into (null = the
default ``expdir/chat/``). If you forked, the whole tree is saved beside it as
``<same>.session.json``, which ``resume:`` reads back — as does a plain ``.traj.json``, which
resumes as a single branch.
