"""Request and Response dataclasses for batch inference.

A :class:`Request` is one chat-completion input — a list of OpenAI-shape messages
(``{"role": ..., "content": ...}``). :meth:`Request.coerce` normalizes the looser
inputs :func:`~nanoagent.inference.engine.infer` accepts (a plain prompt string, a single
message dict, or a bare message list) into one.

A :class:`Response` is the normalized result of one request: the completion ``text``,
the model's ``reasoning`` (``<think>`` trace, when the backend separates it), any
``tool_calls`` the model requested, token ``usage``, computed ``cost``, the model's
``finish_reason``, an ``error`` string that is set (with ``text`` left ``None``) when
the item failed after the backend exhausted its retries, and — when a tokenizer is
configured — the :class:`Tokens` behind that text.

A :class:`ToolCall` is one model-requested tool invocation, normalized away from any
provider's wire shape — ``(id, name, arguments)``, so an agent harness's own tool-call type
maps onto it field-for-field through a thin adapter.

:class:`Tokens` and :class:`Fidelity` are the token-level half of the contract. Text is what
a provider returns; token ids are what a trainer needs, and only some paths can supply the
real ones — so every token record says which kind it is instead of leaving the caller to guess.
