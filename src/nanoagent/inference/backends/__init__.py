"""Backend factory: select a transport by name with deferred imports.

:func:`build_backend` maps ``config.backend`` to a concrete backend and calls its
``from_config``. The lookup is :func:`nanoagent.inference.plugins.load_backend_class`: a built-in module
in this package if there is one, else a ``<name>.py`` in a plugin directory (see
:mod:`nanoagent.inference.plugins` for why a site's own transport lives outside ``src/``). Either way the
module is imported only when its name is selected — so importing this package never pulls in
the ``openai`` SDK until the sglang path is actually chosen.

It is also where ``config.tokenizer`` is honoured, so that every caller — the batch engine, the
harness's :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.model.Model`, a plugin transport that has never heard of
any of this — gets the same token guarantee from the one place a backend is built.
