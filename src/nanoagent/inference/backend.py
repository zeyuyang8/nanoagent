"""Backend protocol with a shared async retry helper and a token-cost helper.

A backend turns one chat-message list into a :class:`~nanoagent.inference.types.Response`. The
sglang transport (:mod:`nanoagent.inference.backends.sglang`) implements :class:`Backend`.

:func:`retry_async` wraps a coroutine factory with exponential backoff, re-raising
immediately on caller-declared ``abort_errors`` (e.g. 4xx auth / bad-request, which
won't succeed on retry). The backoff schedule is ``base_delay * 2**attempt``. This
module imports no provider SDK, so importing it never pulls in the sglang backend's
``openai`` dependency.

:func:`token_cost` turns a usage dict and per-1M-token prices into the dollar cost of
one call — one formula every backend shares rather than each re-deriving it.

    retrying a shared rate limit at once don't re-collide in lockstep (thundering herd).
