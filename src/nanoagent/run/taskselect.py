"""taskselect — the shared three-stage task-subset selector for every CLI that takes a task list.

Both ``nanoagent.run.batch.filter_tasks`` (over ``(task_id, task)`` tuples) and
a benchmark runner's ``select_tasks`` (over its own ``Task`` objects) narrow a
task list the same way; that one body lives here in nanoagent (the runner imports it from here,
the product it already depends on), with the two callers as thin delegators that pass their own id
accessor. Import the public helper::

    from nanoagent.run.taskselect import select_subset

:func:`select_subset` runs up to three stages, in this fixed order, on a copy of the input:

  1. **seeded shuffle** (``shuffle=True``) — sort by ``key`` (ties broken by ``repr`` so equal-``key``
     items get a fixed, input-order-independent order) then shuffle with a local
     ``random.Random(_SHUFFLE_SEED)``, so the order depends only on the items and the fixed seed,
     not the caller's input order;
  2. **regex filter** (``filter_re``) — keep items whose ``key(item)`` ``re.search``-matches;
  3. **slice** (``slice_spec``) — an ``a:b`` (or ``a:b:step``) spec applied as ``out[slice(*parts)]``.

A falsy argument skips its stage, so the all-default call is just a fresh list copy.
