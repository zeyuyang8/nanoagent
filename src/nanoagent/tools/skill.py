"""Skills — prompt material assembled at build time.

A **skill** is a folder ``<skills_dir>/<name>/SKILL.md`` whose YAML frontmatter carries a
``name`` and a ``description``. Only the descriptions go into the system prompt, one line each;
the body is fetched by calling the :class:`Skill` tool. That split is the whole point: twenty
skills cost twenty lines of context, and the one the agent actually needs costs its full text
only on the turn it needs it. Bundling all twenty bodies up front would spend the window on
nineteen documents that never get read.

The index is assembled once by :func:`~nanoagent.run.build.build_agent` (alongside the project
context files), so the batch driver, the benchmark runner and the REPL get the same prompt from
one place.
