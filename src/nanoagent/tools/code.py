"""A code-execution tool: the agent writes Python that runs in a subprocess sandbox.

One :class:`CodeExec` ``invoke`` runs a whole Python program in a single subprocess, so the
model can loop, fan out, filter, dedupe and aggregate across many operations with NO model
round-trip per operation. Only what the program PRINTS (its stdout, capped) is returned to
the model; every intermediate the program builds but does not print stays inside the sandbox
and never enters the model's context — the code itself decides what little re-enters context.

State persists across turns through the sandbox filesystem, not an in-memory REPL: the program
runs with its current directory set to a persistent per-task working directory, so a later
``invoke`` can read a file an earlier one wrote (explicit serde — write JSON, read it back).
:meth:`reset` wipes that directory so sandbox state never leaks across tasks; the agent loop
calls it once at the start of every run. The active directory is held PER asyncio context (in a
:class:`contextvars.ContextVar`), so the production fan-out path — ``batch.run_batch`` runs ONE
shared :class:`CodeExec` across concurrent rollouts via ``asyncio.gather`` — gives each rollout
its OWN dir instead of letting one rollout's ``reset`` clobber a peer's live dir.

Isolation gap: this mirrors the local-subprocess model of :class:`~nanoagent.core.tool.Bash` and is
NOT an isolation boundary. The executed code shares the host filesystem, environment and
network and runs as the same user; the only bounds are :attr:`TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (runaway code is
killed) and the stdout cap. A real isolation layer (container/jail) is deliberately out of
scope for this local sandbox.

Decoupling: this module imports only the Python standard library and
:class:`nanoagent.core.tool.Tool` — not nanoagent.inference, not the search/scoring/training packages
that use it, so nanoagent stays standalone and usable with nothing but the stdlib. Any in-sandbox
capability (e.g. a search helper) enters ONLY through the optional ``preamble`` injection
point — Python source prepended to the model's code before execution — which ships empty by
default.
