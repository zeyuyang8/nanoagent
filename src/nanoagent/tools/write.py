"""The agent writes its own tools.

:func:`~nanoagent.core.tool.get_tools` already means a new tool is a new ``.py`` plus a new ``.yaml``
and no change to nanoagent — so an agent that can write those two files can extend itself, and
this module is only the plumbing that lets it: write, validate by loading it the same way a
configured tool is loaded, and register the result on the live agent so it is callable on the
very next turn. A broken module comes back as the import error, which the model reads as an
ordinary tool result and fixes.

Persistence needs no code at all: the files land in ``tools_dir``, and
:func:`~nanoagent.run.build.build_prompt_and_tools` globs that directory at startup, so a tool
written in one session is simply part of the toolset in the next.

Isolation: a tool the agent wrote is arbitrary Python executed in-process as the same user —
the boundary :class:`~nanoagent.tools.bash.Bash` and :class:`~nanoagent.tools.code.CodeExec` already
document. ``tools_dir: null``, the default in every config here, means this tool is not loaded.
