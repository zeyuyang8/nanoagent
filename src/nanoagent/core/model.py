"""The chat model the agent loop talks to — a thin adapter over :mod:`nanoagent.inference`.

:class:`Model` is the single public backend (a :class:`~nanoagent.core.agent.ChatModel`): the
agent loop and interactive session only ever see
``Model.query(messages, tools, *, on_delta=None) -> Reply`` and never import a provider SDK.
It owns no transport of its own — all inference (tool-schema encoding, streaming, retry, the
transports themselves) lives in :mod:`nanoagent.inference`, and this module is the ONE place the
loop side reaches into it. :class:`Model` just:

  1. translates the loop's :class:`~nanoagent.config.ModelConfig` into a
     :class:`~nanoagent.inference.config.LeanInferConfig` (carrying the fields by name),
  2. builds the matching backend via :func:`nanoagent.inference.backends.build_backend`, and
  3. maps each :class:`~nanoagent.inference.types.Response` onto the loop's
     :class:`~nanoagent.core.agent.Reply` (text + tool calls + usage + cost + reasoning).

``ModelConfig.backend`` names the transport and is passed through verbatim, to be resolved
against the built-ins (``"sglang"``, the OpenAI SDK against an SGLang ``/v1`` endpoint) and then
against the plugin directories in ``$NANOAGENT_PLUGINS`` — which is how ``backend: mygateway``
finds ``mygateway.py`` in a directory the package does not ship. There is deliberately no
allowlist here: it would have to be edited for every new plugin, and
:mod:`nanoagent.inference.plugins` already names the backends it did find and the directories it
searched when it rejects one. The transport module is imported only when the backend is built, so
constructing one never pulls in another's stack.
