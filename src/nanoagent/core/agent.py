"""Minimal async agent loop: the model calls structured tools until it answers.

The agent seeds a system + user message, then loops: ask the model (advertising
``tools`` via OpenAI tool-calling), and
  * if the reply has no tool call -> that is the final answer, stop;
  * otherwise dispatch each tool call by name to its :class:`Tool`, append the
    results as ``role="tool"`` messages, and continue.

It stops early on ``max_steps``, ``cost_limit``, ``token_limit`` or ``context_window``. Tool
errors are fed back to the model (not raised) so it can recover. Token/cost usage is
accumulated across turns onto :class:`AgentResult`.

This is the ONLY agent loop in the package. The batch driver (:mod:`nanoagent.run.batch`,
a benchmark runner) calls :meth:`Agent.run` directly; the human-in-the-loop REPL
(:mod:`nanoagent.repl.app`) drives the same method through its optional hooks
(``messages`` for a persistent transcript, ``on_delta`` for live streaming) and wraps its
model and tools to narrate and confirm — so there is no second loop to drift.

Two optional seams onto that loop, both ``None`` by default and each guarded at its call site,
so a run that does not use them executes exactly the code it did before they existed:
``hooks`` (:mod:`nanoagent.core.hooks`) can inject a reminder before a model call, short-circuit a
tool call, or observe one; ``events`` (:mod:`nanoagent.core.events`) mirrors the run to an NDJSON
stream. Both are split per-run inside :meth:`run` — a :class:`~nanoagent.core.hooks.RunHooks` and a
:class:`~nanoagent.core.events.RunEvents` — because the :class:`Agent` itself is shared.

Run many agents concurrently against one model with
``asyncio.gather(*(agent.run(t) for t in tasks))``; :meth:`run` keeps no state on the
instance, so one :class:`Agent` is safe to share across concurrent rollouts.

Clean-room: depends only on :mod:`nanoagent.core.tool` and the ``ChatModel`` duck-type below —
no ``openai`` import (the concrete backend lives in :mod:`nanoagent.core.model`, which adapts
inference ``Response`` objects into the :class:`Reply` shape this loop consumes).
