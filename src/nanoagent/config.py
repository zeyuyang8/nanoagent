"""Typed, OmegaConf-backed structured run configuration.

A run is described by :class:`RunConfig`, which nests :class:`ModelConfig` (how to reach the
model — SGLang served name, endpoint, sampling, prices) and :class:`AgentConfig` (how to drive
the loop — system prompt, step/cost limits), plus ``tools`` (the toolset, as tool-config YAML
paths; see :func:`~nanoagent.core.tool.get_tools`) and ``task`` / ``output`` for what to run and
where to write it. :class:`InteractiveConfig` and :class:`BatchConfig` extend it for the
``chat`` and batch ``run`` modes; :class:`BrowseConfig` is a standalone schema for the
``browse`` viewer. Everything is yaml-driven — the CLIs take no argparse flags, only
``key=value`` tokens (see :func:`load_config_args`), so all knobs live in the YAML.

A YAML (plus optional dotted ``key=value`` overrides) is merged onto the structured
schema by :func:`load_config`. Two rules, enforced recursively at load time:

  * NO field has a default — every leaf is ``MISSING`` and must be set explicitly in the YAML
    (a config fully specifies the run; nothing is silently filled in). An unset leaf raises; a
    nullable field that is "off" must still be present, set to ``null`` (e.g. ``cost_limit: null``),
    and an empty collection must be written out (e.g. ``tools: []``);
  * unknown keys are rejected (OmegaConf struct mode).

CLI entry points pass ``["<file>.yaml", "agent.max_steps=30", ...]``; later specs win.
