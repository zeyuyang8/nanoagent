"""Structured file tools: ``read`` / ``write`` / ``edit``, scoped to the rollout's workspace.

Structured rather than "just use bash", because an agent editing a file through a shell has to
serialize its intent into a heredoc or a sed expression and hope the quoting survives. ``edit``
takes the old and new text as JSON arguments, so nothing is quoted twice, and an ambiguous edit
(the old text appears more than once) is rejected instead of silently changing the wrong line.

Every path resolves under ``workspace.current() / root`` and is rejected if it escapes it. That
is a scoping rule, not a sandbox: like :class:`~nanoagent.harness.tools.bash.Bash` these run in-process as
the same user, and nothing stops the agent reaching outside via ``bash``.

``provenance``, when a YAML sets it, is the audit trail: one JSONL row per byte-changing call,
so every file the agent authored is attributable after the fact. ``null`` disables it.
