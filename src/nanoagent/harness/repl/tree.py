"""Branching conversations: a session is a tree of transcripts, not one list.

A chat transcript is already just a ``list[dict]`` that :meth:`Agent.run
<nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent.run>` appends to in place, so a branch is a copy of that list and a tree is
a list of copies plus a pointer. That is the whole of :class:`SessionTree`. It buys the thing a
single transcript cannot do: try an approach, see it go wrong, and go back to *before* it without
losing the good half of the session, or explore two answers to the same question side by side.

Nodes are flat and reference their parent by index, so the tree serializes as plain JSON with no
cycles and ``/branches`` is a list comprehension. ``fork`` deep-copies rather than sharing: the
whole point is that what happens in the child must not reach the parent, and every message the
loop touches is a mutable dict.

Resume reads either format. A ``.session.json`` written by :meth:`save` restores the branches;
a ``.traj.json`` from :mod:`nanoagent.harness.run.trajectory` — a batch rollout, or an older chat — restores
its transcript as a single-node tree, so a run you want to pick up is resumable whether or not it
was a chat.
