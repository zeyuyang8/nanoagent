"""Slash commands: everything you can type at a REPL prompt that isn't a task.

One ``{name: handler}`` table instead of an if-chain, for the reason a table always beats a chain
once there are more than a few: ``/h`` can list what exists, and a config can ADD to it. A handler
takes the session and the rest of the line, and returns either ``None`` (it did its thing; the
prompt asks again) or a string, which is submitted as the task — that return value is what makes a
prompt template just another command.

A **prompt template** is a ``.md`` file named in ``commands:``. ``notes/review.md`` becomes
``/review``, and its text — with ``$ARGUMENTS`` replaced by the rest of the line — is what gets
submitted. So a workflow you keep retyping becomes a file, with no Python at all.

The mode switches (``/y`` ``/c`` ``/u``) are NOT here: they are answered inside
:meth:`InteractiveSession._read <nanoagent.harness.repl.app.InteractiveSession._read>` because they
change what that read means (in human mode a switch hands control back rather than re-prompting),
which is a property of the reader, not of a command.
