"""Lifecycle hooks: change what a run does without editing the agent loop.

A hook module is a plain ``.py`` defining any subset of four functions, named after the moment
they fire. It is declared by a YAML that names it, exactly like a tool
(``code: path/to/hook.py``), and loaded by :func:`get_hooks`.

.. code-block:: python

    def session_start(ctx) -> None          # once, before the first model turn
    def before_llm(ctx)   -> str | None     # str -> appended as a user turn before the query
    def before_tool(ctx)  -> str | None     # str -> SHORT-CIRCUITS the call and becomes its result
    def after_tool(ctx)   -> None           # observe the result

Two of them can steer the run, and that is the point. ``before_tool`` turns a rule the system
prompt merely *asks* for into one the harness *enforces* — the bm25_v1 harness says "Call search
AT MOST ONCE" in prose and its own comment admits "the tools stay general and enforce nothing";
a hook counting calls in :attr:`HookContext.state` makes the budget real, for every rollout,
without a bespoke tool. ``before_llm`` injects a reminder the same way.

Off is free: ``hooks: []`` makes :func:`get_hooks` return ``None`` and every call site in
:mod:`nanoagent.harness.core.agent` is a ``None`` check, so a run that configures no hooks executes the code
path it did before they existed.
