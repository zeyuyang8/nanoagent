"""Save and load agent run trajectories as ``*.traj.json``.

A trajectory captures one :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.AgentResult` plus
optional caller metadata, in a JSON shape the browser
(:mod:`nanoagent.harness.repl.browser`) can render. The transcript is self-describing: each step's timing
and each tool result's error flag are inlined onto the messages, so there are no parallel
``tool_calls`` / ``step_durations`` arrays to keep aligned with it::
