"""The batch driver — pick the tasks, fan them out over one agent, write the ledger.

Everything the ``run`` subcommand's batch mode does apart from rendering it:

  * :func:`load_tasks` / :func:`filter_tasks` — read a tasks JSONL and narrow it (regex on id,
    ``a:b`` slice, seeded shuffle).
  * :func:`completed_ids` — the ``results.jsonl`` resume ledger, read back as a task_id set.
  * :func:`run_batch` — run every pending task concurrently over ONE shared
    :class:`~nanoagent.harness.core.agent.Agent`, saving a trajectory per task and appending a slim
    ledger row as each finishes.

Progress rendering is :mod:`nanoagent.harness.run.progress`, reached only through ``run_batch``'s
``on_start`` / ``on_step`` / ``on_done`` callbacks — this module prints nothing.
